## 📂 Tasks Overview

1. ** Predicting House Price Using Linear Regression**  
   This project aims to predict the selling price of a house based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms,
   number of bathrooms, location, and more. Using linear regression—a supervised machine learning algorithm—the model learns the
   relationship between these features and the house prices in historical data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.
   This type of predictive modeling is commonly used in real estate analytics to assist buyers, sellers, and agents in decision-making..

3. **Sentiment Analysis for Amazon Reviews**  
   This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to determine whether customer feedback is positive, negative, or neutral.
   By processing textual data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the system can classify the sentiment
   behind each review. This helps businesses understand customer opinions, improve products, and enhance user experience..

5. **Customer Churn Prediction**  
   This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) a company or service based on historical data. By analyzing customer behavior,
   usage patterns, and demographic information, machine learning models can identify key indicators of churn. This helps businesses take proactive steps to
   retain customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction..

Each task is located in its own folder with relevant code and documentation.
